# :star2:Boston Housing Prices : Predictive Learning with Regularized Regression:star2:

This work contains predictive analysis of Boston Housing Prices dataset, with medv as target variable. The analysis is carried out by using Regularized Linear Regression such as Lasso and Ridge method. This analysis is carried out in R (Rstudio).

Just in case you didn't know. The codes are contained in the .Rmd (Rmarkdown) file, whereas the results and codes are neatly combined in the .html file (knitted version of Rmarkdown). Feel free to download and open it üòÉüòâ.

## Objectives
The data is about predicting housing price (medv) in Boston city. All the features can be grouped into :

- Dependent variable: medv, the median value of owner-occupied homes (in thousands of dollars).
- Structural variables indicating the house characteristics: rm (average number of rooms ‚Äúin owner units‚Äù) and age (proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940).
- Neighborhood variables: crim (crime rate), zn (proportion of residential areas), indus (proportion of non-retail business area), chas (river limitation), tax (cost of public services in each community), ptratio (pupil-teacher ratio), black (the black proportion of population) and lstat (percent of lower status of the population).
- Accesibility variables: dis (distances to five Boston employment centers) and rad (accessibility to radial highways ‚Äì larger index denotes better accessibility).
- Air pollution variable: nox, the annual concentration of nitrogen oxide (in parts per ten million).

## Libraries
This work was mainly done using tidyverse environment and glmnet to build the ML model. However, i also used another libraries to make plots and do certain calculations such as:

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- [caTools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caTools/index.html)
- [psych](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html)
- [glmnet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiV1Y7ojqf2AhWpSGwGHcR1AE8QFnoECAIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcran.r-project.org%2Fweb%2Fpackages%2Fglmnet%2Fglmnet.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0GU29lnFgP5bkxNNIICceO)

## Result preview
This data has 506 rows, and that number of samples is actually considered small, making Regularization is a good fit. In this work, it is found that Ridge regression performs better than Lasso and ordinary Linear Regression, with hyperparameter lambda is set to be 0.01 . Consecutively, the RMSE on the validation and test dataset are 4.346 and 6.82, with MAPE for the test dataset equals 17% approximately.

Those metrics show that the model's performance is quite decent even though no feature engineering was done. That step however, is included in the future works section along with better outliers treatment, proposed to improve the accuracy of the model's prediction. By Residual plot figure, it is evident that except for extreme maximum predicted values (upper outlier), the residual plot already fits some of classic linear regression assumptions, such as linearity, homoskesdascity, and no autocorrelation. Furthermore, with VIF calculation and Q-Q plot of Standardized Residual, it is also found that the result also fits No multicollinearity and normality assumption.

## References
Regularization is a method in which a penalty called lambda is added in the Loss Function in order to introduce a bias thus overfitting will not happen. The method also can be divided into 2 methods, Ridge (quadratic lambda) and Lasso (absolute lambda). Meanwhile Lasso method is able to reduce the coefficients of certain variables to be completely zero, the Ridge regression can't.
